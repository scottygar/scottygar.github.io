This week has been a learning curve of sorts.

- JSON handling PoC completed and stored for future use.
- RESTful service PoC completed for PCU and stored for future use.
- IA completed for a new loans service.
- IA completed for PCAO.

IAs are not the easiest thing in the world - Basically trying to step through all the changes you need to make without actually completing them, and trying to foresee any issues this may cause.

The JSON handling is in a state where it works, as long as the order is specified - which isn't really what JSON is about, so some refactoring to do there. (Or the potential purchase of a plugin to make it easier).

RESTful service is completed and ready to use / be adapted for future use in other projects - I think this will happen if we promote the fact that we can do it.

Now for holiday - Bring on Portugal.
