This week has been a fruitful, if extremely long week.

- Factory 1 config is nearing completion.

Yes, that's all I've done. All week. From start to finish. Monday to Friday. ALL WEEK!

Learnings:

- Copying a factory instance is not as easy as it sounds. (Don't try it again - and if you do, be aware that there's a lot of stuff you need to re-configure).
- Jenkins allows for configurable builds, and you can carry variables through those builds for deployment purposes.
- The original SOAP tests that I wrote on my first service were awful, and I need to re-do them.
- SOAP has an option to add the same endpoint to all services, meaning I will waste no further time typing it in manually.
- If you're in the admin console, your build will not deploy.

All in all, it's been a good week for learning. I now know what the build scripts actually do (and where they are failing silently), so I can go and amend them over the next couple of weeks. I really need to get to grips with Datagrid and deployments to SIT before Douglas goes away though.
