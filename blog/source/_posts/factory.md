The learning curve continues:

- Clean setup and config of new Continuous Integration Server (Factory1).
- Loans service completed.
- Update Money Transfer code.
- Demo of JSON parsing for the rest of the team.
- Learning deployment processes for when Douglas is away.

Factory 1 setup has been an absolute beast. (Though I did spend a long time looking at port config, which has been resolved by the VPN I knew nothing about..). The re-config of Tibco machines and Jenkins integration is still being a pest, but I'm getting there.

Loans was a different challenge, but one that went really well. I feel like I'm getting a broader knowledge of the business as a whole.

JSON parse demo went really well - 
The others gave me some food for thought and some tweaks I could make.

Deployment processes seem.... interesting. There's a lot of paperwork, and I need the full end to end process documented before Douglas leaves.

In other news, CB didn't like my App idea that I submitted, so some thinking to do before next year.
