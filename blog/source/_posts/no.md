**This Week:**

- I have said no. On multiple occasions. And nothing bad has come of it.
	- JobFamilies is complete and we're not implementing top scrollbars.
	- Company-wide JobFamilies is not going to be made by us.
	- The SMF tool isn't an option for us. We just don't have time.

- Factory 2 mocks have had my life for several days, and I have admitted defeat; for now.

+ I have finished my Qualys VBA coding and handed off.
+ I am looking at parsing JSON into Tibco, library imports and java are not playing easily, but I am trying to get a handle on it.
+ Tibco training went well, though I don't feel I actually learnt much (The highlight was correcting the textbook).
