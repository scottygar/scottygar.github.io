## About

The google maps tag plugin for hexo is designed to be a way to add simple maps to your hexo site. The main tag, called `googlemaps` requires an endtag called `endgooglemaps`.

The main tag can have up to 5 arguments, with none being required. If a map is created without a center point, it will default to the first marker's center point. If a zoom level is not specified, it will default to 8.

```
{% googlemaps latitude longitude zoom width height %}
```

The content area is intended to be a list of markers. Each marker is to be on a separate line, in the order of its z index. Top of the list is z index of 0 and so on)

Each marker can take 4 arguments, and the first three are required. The properties are separated by `,`

```
Title, Latitude, Longitude, Icon

```

* Title Text : This is the message that appears if you click the marker.
* Latitude: The latitude of the marker
* Longitude: The Longitude of the marker
* Icon (optional): a url of a marker icon. This can be relative to a icon in the hexo install or locaded elsewhere on a cdn.
This replaces the usual icon ![http://i.imgur.com/ljtDDxV.png](http://i.imgur.com/ljtDDxV.png)
